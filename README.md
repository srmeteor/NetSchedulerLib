# NetSchedulerLib
NetSchedulerLib is lite, Net8 based, Event Scheduler Library, created based on Crestron.SimplSharp.Scheduler.
Purpose of this Library is to replace Crestron Scheduler on Net8 based systems, but it can be used in other Net based systems

## Features
- Recurrence: Every-minute, Every-hour, Every-day, Every-week, Every-month and Ever-year.
- Additional Recurrence setting for Every-week (selected days in week) and Every-month (selected month days)
- If Recurrence is set, no Exception will be thrown for DateTime in the past; first DateTime in the future, meeting Recurrence criteria will be used instead.
- Every EsEvent has an Actions property with a dynamic callback.

## Prerequisites
- NET8.0 with included nuget packages: SolarCalculator (for calculating Astronomical events times), Newtonsoft.Json (for configurations) and Serilog for logging

## Installation
There is a TestScheduler project as example of EventScheduler usage. Test-Profile.json is provided (EmbeddedResource) as example profile configuration.
